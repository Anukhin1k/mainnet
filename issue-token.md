# Validator issue Token

#### Why issue tokens?

For users who have already set up validator nodes, they can issue their own tokens as long as they lock up a certain amount of GGT.

GARD staked by the validator node creator can still enjoy the rewards, and the rewards generated from the GARD staked to the node can be collected according to the fixed commission ratio, and the issued TOKEN will be given to the staker, and it can also be airdropped to other nodes. Later, it can be traded on DEX and also SWAPPED.

For example:

If the node `commission rate`=1, all the GARD and GGT generated by staked GARD will be distributed to the node creator, and the stakers will obtain the issued TOKEN.

If the `commission rate` is less than 1, the stakers can obtain the corresponding GARD and GGT generated from the staked GARD, and also obtain the TOKEN issued by the node.

As long as the self-built node validator maintains the minimum amount of staked GARD, the token issued by the node can be continuously mined.


#### Notes for node owners to issue TOKEN:

##### 1. The issuance of TOKEN must be at least self-staking GARD and locked GGT according to the rules. Please check the amount and GGT lock period by querying the staking issuance TOKEN configuration command;

查询命令：

```
hashgardcli query staking issue-token-config --home <path>
```

返回结果：

{
  "lock_coins": [
    {
      "denom": "uggt",
      "amount": "1000000000000"
    }
  ],
  "lock_period_height": "10512000",
  "min_self_delegation": "10000000000000"
}
```

##### 2. To issue TOKEN, you can configure whether to pre-mine the specified amount to the specified address;

##### 3. You can mine the tokens issued by your node only when your node propose blocks. You can specify the amount of your node and all voting nodes that can be mined in each block;

##### 4. After the node unbundling expires, the minimum staking part of the self-staking GARD according to the issuance rules will be transferred to the lock-up address corresponding to the issued TOKEN, and the rest will be returned to the owner's address;

##### 5. After the node unbinding expires, the locked GGT will be transferred to the locked address corresponding to the issued TOKEN according to the rules within the locked height, otherwise it will be returned to the owner's address;

##### 6. After the node unbinding expires, anyone can submit a proposal to withdraw GARD and GGT from the lockup address corresponding to the issued TOKEN, and all nodes will vote to agree whether they can be withdrawn;

`denom`-The name of issued TOKEN starts with u. For example, if a TOKEN named EXP is issued, then in [denom], pls fills in [uexp].

`total_supply`-total amount of issued token, the default decimal is 6 digits, for example: if 10000 TOKEN is issued, then in [total_supply], please fill in [10000000000] (1EXP=1000000uexp).

`pre_mint_address`-if pre-mining is required, fill in the wallet address where the pre-mined tokens will be stored.

`pre_mint_amount`-if pre-mining is required, fill in the pre-mined token quantity, if not, fill in 0
The block height when the issued TOKEN starts mining.

`genesis_height`: the block height when the token issued starts mining.
